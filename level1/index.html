    <h1>Welcome to the web dev review game</h1>
    <p>See if you can make your way through 7 levels of honestly pretty random challenges that use different things that we learned throughout the course there are easter eggs on most pages as well, also <em> random.</em> if you need a hint, just stay on the page for a little bit, a hint will appear and don't you dare inspect the <b>source code</b> on any of these pages</p>
    <br>
    <p>good luck and have fun trying to figure out the challenges</p>
    
    <p id="hint" class="hidden"> Actually you are allowed to inspect the code, it might be helpful on this one</p>
